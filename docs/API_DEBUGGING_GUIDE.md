# API Call Debugging - Why Mock Data is Still Showing

## üîç Issue Identified
The Previous Brand Analyses section is showing mock data instead of calling the real API because of authentication issues.

## ‚úÖ Backend Verification
I tested your backend manually:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5002/api/brand-llm-analysis/previous"
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Backend is running and responding
**Response**: `{"message": "Token is missing"}` (401 Unauthorized)
**Conclusion**: The endpoint exists but requires authentication

## üêõ Root Cause
The API call is failing due to missing or invalid authentication token, causing the system to fall back to mock data.

## üîß Debugging Enhancements Added

### 1. Enhanced Console Logging
Added detailed logging to track:
- Token presence in localStorage
- Token value (for debugging)
- API service token status
- Full error details

### 2. Token Refresh Method
Added `refreshToken()` method to API service to ensure token is current before API calls.

### 3. Better Error Reporting
Enhanced error logging to show exactly why API calls are failing.

## üîç Debug Steps for You

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
When you refresh the Brand LLM Analysis page, look for these logs:

```
Loading previous analyses...
Current auth token: Present/Missing
Token value: [actual token or null]
Token refreshed from localStorage: Present/Missing
Making API call to: /api/brand-llm-analysis/previous
Auth token in API service: Present/Missing
Token value in API service: [actual token or null]
```

### Step 2: Check Authentication Status
Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Check for:
- `llmredi_token` - Should contain a valid JWT token
- `llmredi_user` - Should contain user data

### Step 3: Verify Login Status
1. Make sure you're logged in to the application
2. Check that login was successful
3. Verify token was saved to localStorage

### Step 4: Test API Call Manually with Token
If you have a valid token, test it manually:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5002/api/brand-llm-analysis/previous" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: No Token in localStorage
**Symptoms**: Console shows "Token: Missing"
**Solution**: 
1. Log out and log back in
2. Check if login process is working correctly
3. Verify token is being saved during login

### Issue 2: Invalid/Expired Token
**Symptoms**: Console shows "Token: Present" but API returns 401
**Solution**:
1. Check if token is expired
2. Log out and log back in to get fresh token
3. Verify token format is correct JWT

### Issue 3: API Service Not Getting Token
**Symptoms**: localStorage has token but API service shows "Missing"
**Solution**: Already fixed with `refreshToken()` method

### Issue 4: CORS or Network Issues
**Symptoms**: Network errors in console
**Solution**: 
1. Verify backend is running on port 5002
2. Check proxy configuration
3. Restart React dev server

## üéØ Expected Console Output (Success)

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Loading previous analyses...
Current auth token: Present
Token value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Token refreshed from localStorage: Present
Making API call to: /api/brand-llm-analysis/previous
Proxied to: http://localhost:5002/api/brand-llm-analysis/previous
Auth token in API service: Present
Token value in API service: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
API response for previous analyses: [array of analyses]
Successfully loaded X previous analyses from API
```

## üéØ Expected Console Output (Failure)

If failing, you'll see:
```
Loading previous analyses...
Current auth token: Missing (or Present)
Token value: null (or actual token)
API call failed for previous analyses, using mock data: [error details]
Full error details: [detailed error information]
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Refresh the page** and check browser console
2. **Look for the debug logs** I added
3. **Check authentication status** in localStorage
4. **Share the console output** with me so I can help debug further

The enhanced debugging will show exactly where the issue is occurring!
